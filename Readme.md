# PW - Assignment

Let's Slice and dice

# Description

1. An API to add a new record to the dataset.
2. An API to delete a new record to the dataset.
3. An API to fetch SS for salary over the entire dataset. You can ignore the currency (if not
mentioned otherwise) of the salary and simply treat salary as a number.
4. An API to fetch SS for salary for records which satisfy "on_contract": "true".
5. An API to fetch SS for salary for each department. This means that whatever youâ€™ll do in
Step 3, should be done for each department. The return of this API should have 1 SS
available for each unique department.
6. An API to fetch SS for salary for each department and sub-department combination. This
is similar to Case 5 but 1 level of nested aggregation.
